user,what jobs have common skills as mine ? can you give me a percentage match ?
assistant,"I would need to know what specific skills you possess in order to provide a percentage match for potential jobs. However, some common skills that are often transferable across a variety of roles include communication, problem-solving, time management, and teamwork. 

If you can provide more information about your skills and experience, I can help identify potential job roles that align with your skill set and provide a percentage match based on that information."
